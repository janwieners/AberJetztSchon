# AberJetztSchon

Built this for my daughter (and me) in order to find some nice playgrounds wherever we are. Enjoy!

Based on Angular, Leaflet, OpenStreetMap / Overpass, built with â™¥.

Running app: https://playgroundlove.jan-wieners.de.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
