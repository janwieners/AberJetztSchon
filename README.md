# PlaygroundLove

Built this for my daughter and me in order to find some nice playgrounds wherever we are.

Based on Angular, Leaflet, OpenStreetMap's Overpass API.

Running app: https://jan-wieners.de/dev/playgroundlove.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
